Html5PyTagcloud is aimed to provide an example on how to build a tag cloud using
the html + javascript tagcloud from goat1000 (http://www.goat1000.com/).

The tagcloud is created based on some given text, stop words are filtered using the lang package
in PyTagCloud (https://github.com/atizo/PyTagCloud/).

An example is provided in example.py, which reads a text file with some sample text from wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Revolution) and creates an output file (sample_cloud.html by default)
in the running directory.

To run this example just open a shell and run: 
   $python example.py
